0x08. C - Recursion
Recursion in C programming is a technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a specific condition is met. In other words, it's a way of solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller sub-problems that are similar to the original problem. These sub-problems are solved by calling the same function again, and the process continues until the base case is reached.
